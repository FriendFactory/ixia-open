# Ixia Open Source

**Ixia AI** is a generative media platform for mobile that enabled social, AI-assisted content creation. Users can create characters‚Äîstarting from scratch or using a selfie‚Äîand use those characters as consistent input across a range of outputs including images, videos, and remixes.

Ixia features a guided image prompt assistant, allowing users to construct detailed prompts through UI selections, enhanced with live feedback from an OpenAI-based assistant. A video prompt assistant to enable users to select or upload an image, analyze it via OpenAI, and receive theme-based video suggestions.

The platform includes a complete subscription, IAP, and token-based economy, and is built for high responsiveness and real-time creative feedback. This open source release includes the mobile Unity client, backend, bridge, CMS, and a collection of ComfyUI-based generative workflows.
